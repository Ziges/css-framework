## The task
In this exercise I learnt to use the bootstrap front-end library to create a nice card layout using bootstrap responsive grids. 
The idea behind this challenge was to leverage the bootstrap framework (v4.5.3) as much as possible and keep any use of CSS to a minimum.

The inner structure of each card consists of:
 
1. Images and icons using:
    * www.flaticon.com/home 
    * www.fontawesome.com
    
2. A centered bootstrap card title and text.

3. A bootstrap button with a tooltip and colour change on hover with mouse.
    * JS function added to bottom of HTML page: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/tooltips/
    
4. A nav sidebar with some dummy links. The sidebar vanishes for viewports < 768px 

5. Lastly, the cards are responsive meaning they stack according to screen size, for a more pleasant reading experience. 

##### I'm excited to use another framework like tailwind for this exercise.
